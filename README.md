# Virtual Engineering Workbench (VEW)

Modern engineering organizations — particularly in automotive, manufacturing, and embedded systems — face a common set of challenges:

- **Hardware scarcity**: Physical prototypes and development boards are expensive and in short supply during early development stages.
- **Environment complexity**: Setting up toolchains, simulators, and IDEs for embedded development takes days or weeks per developer.
- **Collaboration barriers**: Distributed teams need shared, reproducible environments that work identically regardless of location.
- **Slow feedback loops**: Validating software against virtual targets should happen continuously, not only when hardware is available.

VEW addresses these by providing a unified platform where platform engineers define and publish ready-to-use development environments (workbenches), and developers provision them on demand through a web portal.

## Business use cases

| Use case | How VEW helps |
| --- | --- |
| Cloud-based development environments | Pre-configured workbenches with IDEs, compilers, and debuggers — launched in minutes |
| Virtual target simulation | Run software-in-the-loop (SiL) tests against virtual hardware models in the cloud |
| AMI factory | Automated, repeatable image creation using EC2 Image Builder with versioned components and recipes |
| Multi-tenant project isolation | Separate environments, access controls, and cost tracking per project and team |
| Self-service provisioning | Developers browse a product catalog and launch workbenches without filing tickets |
| Remote desktop access | Secure browser-based access to Windows and Linux workbenches via Amazon DCV |

## Core pillars

- **Tools** — Pre-configured development environments, IDEs, and toolchains
- **Targets** — Platform abstraction, virtualization, and target configurations
- **Environments** — Validation infrastructure, simulation, and test data
- **Automation** — CI/CD, environment provisioning, and artifact management
- **Self-Service Portal** — RBAC, project management, and workflow orchestration

## Architecture overview

VEW is built on AWS serverless technologies using hexagonal architecture with Domain-Driven Design (DDD) patterns. The platform separates business logic from infrastructure through bounded contexts, each independently deployable.

VEW supports two deployment modes:

- **Public** — CloudFront + Lambda@Edge + S3 for the frontend, public API Gateway endpoints. Suitable when users access the platform over the internet.
- **Private** — Application Load Balancer within a VPC for the frontend, private API Gateway endpoints via VPC endpoints. Suitable when the platform must remain within a corporate network.

### Private deployment - architecture

### Technology stack

| Layer | Technology |
| --- | --- |
| Backend | Python 3.13, AWS Lambda, Lambda Powertools |
| API | Amazon API Gateway (REST) with both Lambda and IAM authorization |
| Database | Amazon DynamoDB |
| Frontend | React 18, TypeScript, Vite, Cloudscape Design System |
| Authentication | Amazon Cognito with OIDC/SAML federation |
| CDN and protection | CloudFront, Lambda@Edge, WAF |
| Events | Amazon EventBridge (bus, pipes, scheduler) |
| Orchestration | AWS Step Functions, AWS Service Catalog |
| Image building | EC2 Image Builder |
| Infrastructure | AWS CDK v2 (Python for backend, TypeScript for frontend) |

### Bounded contexts

Each bounded context is an independent service with its own API, data store, and deployment:

| Context | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| **Authorization** | API authorization and permission validation using Cedar policies |
| **Projects** | Project lifecycle, membership, enrollment, and resource allocation |
| **Packaging** | AMI components, recipes, EC2 Image Builder pipelines and images |
| **Publishing** | Service Catalog products, versions, and portfolio management |
| **Provisioning** | Product launch/terminate, workbench lifecycle management |
| **Usecase** | Minimal skeleton demonstrating how a new bounded context plugs into a use-case account (template/reference) |
| **Shared** | Common utilities, DDD helpers, middleware, instrumentation |

### Design patterns

- **Hexagonal architecture** — Domain logic at the center, ports define contracts, adapters implement infrastructure
- **CQRS** — Separate command handlers (writes) from query services (reads)
- **Repository + Unit of Work** — Transactional consistency for DynamoDB operations
- **Domain Events** — EventBridge for cross-context communication
- **Value Objects** — Self-validating DTOs with factory methods

See [backend/README.md](backend/README.md) and [frontend/README.md](frontend/README.md) for detailed structure, setup, and development instructions.

## Deployment

> **Region constraint (public deployments only):** Public deployments must use **us-east-1**, because WAFv2 WebACLs with `CLOUDFRONT` scope must be created there and the public frontend stack does not handle cross-region WAF deployment. **Private deployments** (`PRIVATE_DEPLOYMENT=true`) use an internal ALB with no CloudFront/WAF and can be deployed to any region — set `AWS_REGION` to your target region.

### Prerequisites

| Requirement | Version | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| AWS CLI | v2 | AWS resource management |
| AWS CDK | v2 | Infrastructure deployment |
| Node.js | 24+ | Frontend build, CDK (TypeScript) |
| Python | 3.13+ | Backend application, CDK (Python) |
| uv | 0.11+ | Python dependency management |
| Yarn | 4.x | Frontend package management |
| jq | any | JSON processing in deploy script |
| openssl | any | Only for private deployments without `CERT_ARN` (generates the self-signed certificate). Preinstalled on macOS and in the Docker deployer image |
| Docker | any | Required on macOS/Windows for Lambda bundling and ECS image builds. On Linux, only needed for ECS task image builds. |

You also need:

- An AWS account with credentials configured (admin or PowerUser access for initial deployment)
- The account must be part of an AWS Organization (the deploy script reads the Organization ID)
- TLS certificates in ACM (optional — for custom domains)
- OIDC client credentials (optional — for corporate login federation)

### Ubuntu / WSL setup

```bash
# System packages
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y software-properties-common jq docker.io unzip curl openssl

# Python 3.13
sudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:deadsnakes/ppa
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y python3.13 python3.13-venv python3.13-dev
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/python3 python3 /usr/bin/python3.13 2

# Node 24 + Yarn 4
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_24.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt install -y nodejs
sudo npm install -g aws-cdk
sudo corepack enable
corepack prepare yarn@4.14.1 --activate

# uv (Python package manager)
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# AWS CLI v2
cd /tmp
curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"
unzip awscliv2.zip && sudo ./aws/install && rm -rf aws awscliv2.zip

# Docker permissions
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER && newgrp docker
```

**WSL users:** Copy the repository to the Linux filesystem before running the deploy script. Python venvs and Yarn fail on `/mnt/c` (Windows filesystem).

```bash
cp -r /mnt/c/path/to/vew /tmp/vew && cd /tmp/vew
```

### Quick start (Docker)

If you'd rather skip local prerequisite setup entirely, build and run the deployer image. First, create a config file from the provided sample and fill in your values (see [Configuration reference](#configuration-reference) for all available parameters):

```bash
cp config.env deploy-config.env
# Edit deploy-config.env with your values
```

Then build and run:

```bash
docker build -t vew-deployer .
docker run --rm -it \
  -v "$(pwd)":/app \
  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
  -e AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID \
  -e AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY \
  -e AWS_SESSION_TOKEN \
  -e AWS_SPOKE_ACCESS_KEY_ID \
  -e AWS_SPOKE_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY \
  -e AWS_SPOKE_SESSION_TOKEN \
  -e AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-1 \
  vew-deployer --config /app/deploy-config.env
```

The Docker socket mount (`-v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock`) is required for ECS task image builds. Pass credentials via environment variables — no AWS profile configuration needed inside the container.

### Quick start

```bash
chmod +x deploy.sh
./deploy.sh
```

The script prompts for all required parameters interactively, then executes 10 phases:

1. Validates prerequisites (`aws`, `cdk`, `node`, `python`, `uv`, `jq`, `yarn`)
1. Patches source configuration files with your org/app prefix and region
1. CDK bootstraps the target account (and `us-east-1` if deploying to another region)
1. Creates prerequisite resources (SSM parameters, VPC, service-linked roles)
1. Configures identity federation (OIDC secret in Secrets Manager)
1. Deploys frontend infrastructure (Cognito, CloudFront, S3, WAF)
1. Deploys backend infrastructure (Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, EventBridge)
1. Builds and uploads the frontend web application to S3
1. Seeds DynamoDB with an admin user and default program
1. Optionally bootstraps a spoke account for workbench provisioning

### Using a config file

```bash
cp config.env deploy-config.env
# Edit deploy-config.env with your values
./deploy.sh --config deploy-config.env
```

The script saves a config file after the first run at `.deploy-config-{env}` for re-runs.

### What gets patched

The deploy script replaces default values in source files before deploying:

| File | What changes |
| --- | --- |
| `backend/infra/config.py` | Org/app prefix, Cognito region, enabled workbench regions |
| `backend/infra/constants.py` | Lambda architecture (ARM/x86), local bundling flag, private API endpoint toggle |
| `frontend/infrastructure/cdk.json` | App name, deployment qualifier, OIDC settings, private deployment flag, VPC name |
| `frontend/infrastructure/lib/public-access-deployment-stack.ts` | Monitoring resource name prefix |

If you deploy with the defaults (`proserve`/`wb`/`us-east-1`), no patching occurs.

### Private deployment

Set `PRIVATE_DEPLOYMENT=true` (in your config file or the interactive prompt) to deploy behind internal Application Load Balancers in a VPC instead of CloudFront. In this mode the platform is never exposed to the internet; users reach it over a corporate network path (VPN, Direct Connect, or Transit Gateway).

Private mode requires `CUSTOM_DOMAIN` and `API_CUSTOM_DOMAIN`, and a TLS certificate. It is **not** pinned to us-east-1 — set `AWS_REGION` to your target region. The certificate is handled by `CERT_ARN`:

- If `CERT_ARN` is set, the script uses your regional ACM certificate in `AWS_REGION` (issued/imported however your organization manages certificates).
- If `CERT_ARN` is empty, the script generates a self-signed certificate with SANs for both domains and imports it into ACM, setting `CERT_ARN` automatically. This is free and fully self-contained, but clients must trust the certificate: distribute it to user trust stores (e.g. via MDM), otherwise browsers reject it and the web app's API calls fail. The certificate is valid for 397 days (under the 398-day browser limit); re-run the deploy to rotate it.

The script then:

- Sets `PRIVATE_API_ENDPOINT = True` (backend) and `PrivateDeployment` / `VPCName` (frontend) automatically.
- Skips the us-east-1 bootstrap and the us-east-1 Cognito certificate (both are CloudFront-only concerns).
- Provisions private API Gateway endpoints (via VPC interface endpoints) fronted by internal ALBs, and an internal ALB serving the web app.
- When `PRIVATE_DNS_AUTOMATE=true` (default), creates a Route 53 private hosted zone associated with the hub VPC and alias records pointing `CUSTOM_DOMAIN` and `API_CUSTOM_DOMAIN` at the two ALBs. Set it to `false` to manage DNS externally (the script then prints the records to create).

The deployment uses the VPC named `vpc-{org}-{app}-{env}`. If it does not exist, Phase 4 creates one; for `qa`/`prod` it provisions one NAT gateway per Availability Zone. Tighten `allowed-cidrs-for-private-api-endpoint` in `backend/infra/config.py` from the default RFC 1918 ranges to your corporate CIDRs.

In private mode, any Lambda that calls a cross-bounded-context API (declared via `cross_bc_api_access` on its `AppEntryPoint`) is automatically attached to that VPC so it can resolve the private API Gateway endpoint through the VPC interface endpoint. Public deployments keep Lambdas outside the VPC to avoid the associated NAT/endpoint cost.

### Post-deployment

After deployment completes, the script prints:

- The CloudFront URL for the web application
- Admin credentials
- The `aws cognito-idp admin-create-user` command (if no OIDC was configured)

DNS records for custom domains must be created manually after the first deployment.

### Cost estimate

Approximate monthly cost for a minimal deployment (us-east-1, no active workbenches):

| Service | Estimated cost |
| --- | --- |
| CloudFront | ~$1 (minimal traffic) |
| Cognito | Free tier (< 50k MAU) |
| Lambda | Free tier (< 1M requests/month) |
| API Gateway | ~$3.50 per million requests |
| DynamoDB | ~$5 (on-demand, minimal usage) |
| S3 | < $1 (static assets) |
| WAF | ~$11 (3 WebACLs × $5 + rules) |
| EventBridge | < $1 |
| Step Functions | < $1 |
| **Total (idle)** | **~$25–35/month** |

Active usage with workbenches adds EC2 instance costs in the spoke account. Use AWS Cost Explorer with the `{org}-{app}-*` tag pattern to track VEW-specific spending.

### Spoke account onboarding

Workbenches are provisioned in spoke accounts, separate from the main platform account. To onboard a spoke account, either provide the spoke account ID during the interactive prompt, or deploy the bootstrap template manually:

```bash
aws cloudformation deploy \
  --template-file backend/setup/prerequisites/vew-spoke-account-bootstrap.yml \
  --stack-name VEW-Spoke-Bootstrap \
  --capabilities CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM \
  --parameter-overrides \
    WebApplicationAccountId=<MAIN_ACCOUNT_ID> \
    WebApplicationEnvironment=dev \
    VPCIdParameterValue=<SPOKE_VPC_ID>
```

This must be deployed into the spoke account, not the main account.

VEW comes pre-configured with a tag based VPC subnet selection strategy to provision workbenches. Subnet selection is defined in [backend/infra/config.py](backend/infra/config.py), `provisioning-subnet-selector` setting. Available subnet selection strategies are:

- _TaggedSubnet_ (default) - filters for subnets tagged with a tag specified in the `provisioning-subnet-selector-tag` setting.
- _PublicSubnet_ - selects a public subnet. Use this for testing purposes only.
- _PrivateSubnetWithTransitGateway_ - selects a private subnet that has a transit gateway route. Use it when workbenches need to be accessible only from the corporate network.

All of the subnet selection strategies pick a subnet with the most remaining IPs left.

If you specify the `SPOKE_ACCOUNT_ID` parameter and leave the `SPOKE_VPC_ID` blank, the deploy script will create a new VPC with public subnets ready for provisioning. If you specify a `SPOKE_VPC_ID` value, then you must tag the subnets on the spoke account using `ProvisioningEnabled` key and `True` value.

## Using VEW

Once deployed, VEW follows a three-stage workflow to deliver development environments to end users:

### 1. Packaging — Build machine images

Platform engineers define what goes into a workbench image:

1. Create **components** — individual software installation and test steps (mapped to EC2 Image Builder components)
1. Assemble components into **recipes** — ordered lists of software to include (mapped to Image Builder recipes)
1. Create **pipelines** — automated builds that produce AMIs from recipes (mapped to Image Builder pipelines)
1. Run the pipeline to produce a tested, versioned **image**

### 2. Publishing — Create products in the catalog

Platform engineers make images available to users:

> **One-time setup:** Products publish into a Service Catalog portfolio that is created when you onboard an AWS account to a technology. Do this once per technology before creating products — see [Onboard a technology account](docs/onboard-an-account.md).

1. Create a **product template** — CloudFormation template defining network, security groups, instance type, storage, and the AMI reference
1. Create a **product** from the template and publish it to the Service Catalog portfolio
1. Create **product versions** as images evolve

### 3. Provisioning — Launch and manage workbenches

Developers use the self-service portal to:

1. Browse **available products** in the catalog
1. **Launch** a product — VEW provisions the underlying EC2 instance via Service Catalog
1. **Start/stop** provisioned products to control costs
1. **Connect** to running workbenches via browser (Amazon DCV) or SSH
1. **Terminate** products when no longer needed

## Getting started

If you just deployed VEW and want to see it in action, start here:

- [Onboard a technology account](docs/onboard-an-account.md) — the one-time platform setup that creates the Service Catalog portfolio products publish into. Do this before building your first product.
- [Build your first product](examples/freertos/README.md) — create a FreeRTOS virtual target from scratch: component, recipe, pipeline, product, and a running instance you can SSH into.
- [Launch a product](docs/launch-a-product.md) — provision any product from the catalog.
- [Connect to a product](docs/connect-to-a-product.md) — reach your running product via browser, DCV client, or SSH.

More examples (Android Cuttlefish, QEMU/KVM) are in the [examples/](examples/) folder.

## Extending VEW

### Adding a new backend bounded context

See [backend/README.md — Extending the backend](backend/README.md#extending-the-backend) for the full walkthrough with code examples covering entrypoints, command handlers, bootstrappers, domain events, and CDK stacks.

Key architectural rules enforced by automated fitness function tests:

- Dependencies point inward only — domain code must never import from adapters or entrypoints
- Bounded contexts are isolated — no imports between contexts
- Ports are owned by the domain — adapters implement domain-defined interfaces
- Cross-context communication uses EventBridge events, not direct imports

### Extending the frontend

See [frontend/README.md — Extending the frontend](frontend/README.md#extending-the-frontend) for adding pages, generating API clients, and UI patterns.

## Security

- JWT and IAM authorization on API Gateway
- JWT validation via Lambda@Edge on every request
- Corporate identity federation through Cognito OIDC/SAML
- WAF on CloudFront, Cognito, and API Gateway with AWS managed rule groups (anonymous IP, IP reputation, known bad inputs, common exploits)
- KMS encryption for AMI artifacts and SNS alarm topics
- Cedar-based fine-grained authorization (Amazon Verified Permissions)
