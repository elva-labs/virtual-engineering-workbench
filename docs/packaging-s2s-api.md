# Packaging service-to-service API

The Packaging S2S API is a thin proof of concept over the existing UI commands for
project-scoped components, recipes, pipelines, and image builds. All resources use
the existing internal IDs. There are no external-ID
mappings, ETags, or separate reconciliation operations. This document describes
the local contract; it does not claim deployed AWS availability.

## Prerequisites

The OAuth client needs these scopes:

- `clients/packaging/component.read`
- `clients/packaging/component.write`
- `clients/packaging/component.release` to release a validated version

An administrator must also assign the client to every project it may access. OAuth scopes grant an action; a project assignment grants access to a particular project. Requests need both.

The examples use these placeholders:

```bash
export CLIENT_ID='<OAuth client ID>'
export CLIENT_SECRET='<OAuth client secret>'
export TOKEN_URL='https://<cognito-domain>/oauth2/token'
export API_BASE_URL='https://<api-host>'
export PROJECT_ID='proj-example'
```

Do not put client credentials in source control or Terraform state.

## Obtain an access token

Request the scopes needed by the workflow with the Cognito client-credentials grant:

```bash
ACCESS_TOKEN="$(
  curl --fail --silent --show-error \
    --user "$CLIENT_ID:$CLIENT_SECRET" \
    --header 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
    --data-urlencode 'grant_type=client_credentials' \
    --data-urlencode 'scope=clients/packaging/component.read clients/packaging/component.write clients/packaging/component.release' \
    "$TOKEN_URL" | jq --raw-output '.access_token'
)"
```

Send the token as `Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN` on every API request.

For recipes and pipelines, request the explicitly granted scopes described below.
Poll each resource's GET endpoint for lifecycle status.

Lifecycle status values are explicit in the OpenAPI contract: components and
recipes use `CREATED`/`ARCHIVED`; component and recipe versions use
`CREATING`, `CREATED`, `TESTING`, `VALIDATED`, `UPDATING`, `RELEASED`, `RETIRED`,
or `FAILED`; pipelines use `CREATING`, `CREATED`, `UPDATING`, `RETIRED`, or
`FAILED`; images use `CREATED`, `CREATING`, `FAILED`, `RETIRED`, or `DELETED`.

## Assign the client to a project

Use a management client with `clients/projects/client_assignment.write` to create or reactivate the assignment. The `clientId` path value is the client ID contained in the Packaging access token.

```bash
curl --fail-with-body --request PUT \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer $MANAGEMENT_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  "$API_BASE_URL/clients/projects/v1/projects/$PROJECT_ID/clients/$CLIENT_ID"
```

The response reports `ACTIVE`. A Packaging request for an unassigned project returns `403 PROJECT_ACCESS_DENIED` before Packaging looks up the requested resource. Deleting the same Projects URL revokes the assignment.

## Component POC

Paths below are relative to `/clients/packaging/v1/projects/{projectId}`.
Components and their versions use the same generated `componentId` and
`componentVersionId` as the UI. Existing UI-created resources are accessible
through these IDs when associated with the authorized project.

| Method | Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `POST` / `GET` | `/components` | Create / list components |
| `GET` / `PUT` / `DELETE` | `/components/{componentId}` | Read, update description, or archive |
| `POST` / `GET` | `/components/{componentId}/versions` | Create / list versions |
| `GET` / `PUT` / `DELETE` | `/components/{componentId}/versions/{versionId}` | Read, update, or retire a version |
| `POST` | `/components/{componentId}/versions/{versionId}/release` | Release a validated version |

Create a component with `POST /components`:

```json
{
  "componentName": "build-agent",
  "componentDescription": "Installs the build agent",
  "componentPlatform": "Linux",
  "componentSupportedArchitectures": ["amd64"],
  "componentSupportedOsVersions": ["Ubuntu 24"]
}
```

The response is `201` with `{"componentId": "comp-..."}`. Use that ID for subsequent
requests. `PUT /components/{componentId}` accepts only `componentDescription`.
Update and archive return `200` with `{}`. GET returns `{component: ...}`; list
returns `{components: [...]}`.

Every managed create (`POST /components`, component versions, recipes, recipe
versions, and pipelines) requires an RFC 4122 UUID `Idempotency-Key` header.
Missing or malformed keys return `400 INVALID_IDEMPOTENCY_KEY`.

Each key is scoped to `(clientId, projectId, operation, parentResourceId?, key)`.
The optional parent is the component or recipe for a version create. The same key
can be used independently in another scope. After request defaults are applied,
object-key order is ignored when comparing bodies; array order is significant.

An exact same-body retry replays the stored status and body for at least 24 hours
after completion. Once that retention period expires, key reuse can create a new
resource, even if DynamoDB has not physically deleted the expired record.
Reusing an active key with a different body returns non-retryable
`409 IDEMPOTENCY_KEY_REUSED`. A matching request with a live lease returns
retryable `409 IDEMPOTENCY_REQUEST_IN_PROGRESS` with `Retry-After: 5`.

Reservations use a 60-second lease and retain the reserved resource ID. After a
lease expires, a retry acquires recovery ownership and checks that ID. If the
resource does not exist, creation is retried using the same ID. If it exists,
synchronous component/recipe creation reconstructs the successful response;
component-version, recipe-version, and pipeline creation resumes workflow
publication while still `CREATING` before completing the reservation. Resources
that have already progressed are not restarted. Publication is at least once,
consistent with EventBridge delivery; retryable publication failures leave the
reservation recoverable. Validation and authorization failures before reservation
do not consume the key.

Create a version with `POST /components/{componentId}/versions` using a structured
component definition:

```json
{
  "componentVersionDescription": "Install the build agent",
  "componentVersionReleaseType": "MAJOR",
  "componentVersionDefinition": {
    "schemaVersion": "1.0",
    "phases": [
      {
        "name": "build",
        "steps": [
          {
            "name": "install",
            "action": "ExecuteBash",
            "inputs": {"commands": ["echo hello"]}
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  },
  "componentVersionDependencies": [],
  "softwareVendor": "Example Corp",
  "softwareVersion": "1.0.0"
}
```

Optional metadata fields are `licenseDashboard` and `notes`. Dependency entries
use the UI's `componentId`, `componentName`, `componentVersionId`,
`componentVersionName`, `componentVersionType`, `order`, and `position` fields;
use internal IDs for dependencies too. Dependencies must be available in the
authorized project.

Component-version create and update validate the body in Lambda so invalid
`componentVersionDefinition` values return non-retryable
`422 INVALID_COMPONENT_DEFINITION`. Definitions require at least one phase and
at least one step per phase. Other request validation failures return
`400 INVALID_REQUEST`. The S2S response returns the canonical structured
definition; the user API continues accepting and returning its original YAML.

Create/update/retire returns `202` with `componentVersionId` and `Retry-After: 5`.
Poll the version GET and inspect `component_version.status`: wait for
`VALIDATED` or `FAILED` after create/update, or `RETIRED` or `FAILED` after
retirement. The response includes `componentVersionDefinition` when a stored
definition is available. Version lists return `{component_versions: [...]}`.

Version update accepts the same fields except `componentVersionReleaseType`,
which is creation-only. Once validated, send a bodyless POST to the release
endpoint. It returns `200` with `componentVersionId`; the existing domain
workflow assigns the final semantic version. Released content is immutable:
create a new version for further edits. DELETE archives the base or retires a
version through the existing lifecycle; it does not physically delete records.

All five managed creates—component, component version, recipe, recipe version, and
pipeline—require the `Idempotency-Key`. Updates, archives, releases, and retirements
do not require it and retain their existing synchronous/asynchronous lifecycle
semantics. There are no external-ID or conditional-update guarantees in this POC.
No existing component/version IDs need migration.

## Recipe POC

Recipe access requires a project assignment and one of these explicitly granted
scopes:

- `clients/packaging/recipe.read` for reads and lists
- `clients/packaging/recipe.write` for create, update, and delete/retire actions
- `clients/packaging/recipe.release` for release

Existing clients are not automatically granted recipe scopes. The POC keeps the
existing domain commands and uses internal IDs; it does not accept or create
external recipe/version IDs, ETags, or recipe mapping records.

The routes are:

| Method | Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `POST` / `GET` | `/clients/packaging/v1/projects/{projectId}/recipes` | Create a recipe / list recipes |
| `GET` / `DELETE` | `/clients/packaging/v1/projects/{projectId}/recipes/{recipeId}` | Read / archive a recipe |
| `POST` / `GET` | `/clients/packaging/v1/projects/{projectId}/recipes/{recipeId}/versions` | Create a version / list versions |
| `GET` / `PUT` / `DELETE` | `/clients/packaging/v1/projects/{projectId}/recipes/{recipeId}/versions/{versionId}` | Read, update, or retire a version |
| `POST` | `/clients/packaging/v1/projects/{projectId}/recipes/{recipeId}/versions/{versionId}/release` | Release a version |

Recipe creation uses the UI fields `recipeName`, `recipeDescription`,
`recipePlatform`, `recipeArchitecture`, and `recipeOsVersion`. Version requests use
`recipeVersionDescription`, `recipeVersionReleaseType`,
`recipeVersionVolumeSize`, `recipeVersionIntegrations`, and
`configuredComponentsVersions`; each component entry must include the internal IDs,
the UI names, `componentVersionType`, and `order`:

```json
{
  "recipeVersionDescription": "Engineering image components",
  "recipeVersionReleaseType": "MINOR",
  "recipeVersionVolumeSize": "30",
  "recipeVersionIntegrations": [],
  "configuredComponentsVersions": [
    {
      "componentId": "comp-0001",
      "componentName": "build-agent",
      "componentVersionId": "vers-0001",
      "componentVersionName": "1.0.0",
      "componentVersionType": "HELPER",
      "order": 1
    }
  ]
}
```

Recipe-version reads expose both views: `configuredComponentsVersions` is the
client-supplied selection, while `effectiveComponentsVersions` is the resolved
selection after mandatory components and ordering have been applied.
Historical versions without saved configured state omit
`configuredComponentsVersions` entirely and still return the effective list.

Components are sorted by `order`; existing mandatory components are added by the
domain workflow. `recipeVersionReleaseType` is accepted only when the
version is created; it is not an update field. A successful recipe create returns
`recipeId`; a version create/update/retire action returns `recipeVersionId`.
`DELETE` archives the recipe base or retires the version; it never physically
deletes the underlying UI resource.

Version create, update, and retire actions return `202 Accepted` with a
`recipeVersionId` and `Retry-After: 5`. Poll
`GET /clients/packaging/v1/projects/{projectId}/recipes/{recipeId}/versions/{versionId}`
until `recipe_version.status` becomes `VALIDATED` or `FAILED` after create/update,
or `RETIRED` or `FAILED` after retirement. Release requires a validated version
whose component versions are all released, and returns the `recipeVersionId`
synchronously. Released content is immutable. This POC reuses the existing build
and test workflows without adding a separate recipe operation reconciler.

Recipe and recipe-version creates require `Idempotency-Key`; replaying a request
with the same key returns the original result. There are no external IDs, ETags,
or operation-reconciler deduplication guarantees for recipes in this POC. Use the
stable problem `code` and `retryable` fields for errors.

## Pipeline and image-build POC

All paths below are relative to `/clients/packaging/v1/projects/{projectId}`.
The client must be assigned to that project and explicitly granted the relevant scopes:

- `clients/packaging/pipeline.read`: pipeline and image reads/lists.
- `clients/packaging/pipeline.write`: create, update, and retire pipelines.
- `clients/packaging/pipeline.execute`: start an image build.

These scopes are not automatically granted to existing clients. There are no
external pipeline IDs, ETags, or pipeline reconciliation operations.

| Method | Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `POST` / `GET` | `/pipelines` | Create / list pipelines |
| `GET` / `PUT` / `DELETE` | `/pipelines/{pipelineId}` | Read / update / retire a pipeline |
| `POST` / `GET` | `/images` | Start a build / list images |
| `GET` | `/images/{imageId}` | Read image build status and resulting AMI ID |

Create a pipeline using the existing internal IDs of a released recipe version:

```json
{
  "pipelineName": "engineering-image",
  "pipelineDescription": "Build the engineering image",
  "recipeId": "reci-example",
  "recipeVersionId": "vers-example",
  "buildInstanceTypes": ["m8i.2xlarge"],
  "pipelineSchedule": "0 0 * * ? *"
}
```

Use build instance types allowed by the deployment's pipeline configuration for the
recipe architecture. The schedule is a six-field expression, without a `cron(...)`
wrapper, matching the UI. Optional `productId` retains the UI's automatic product
version association behavior.

Create/update/retire returns `202` with `pipelineId` and `Retry-After: 5`. Poll the pipeline GET until
`pipeline.status` is `CREATED` or `FAILED` after create/update, or `RETIRED` or
`FAILED` after retirement. Updates accept `buildInstanceTypes`, `pipelineSchedule`,
`recipeVersionId`, and `productId`; the recipe itself, pipeline name, and description
are not mutable through the existing command. As in the UI, omitting `productId`
on update clears the product association.

Pipeline creates require `Idempotency-Key`. Once the pipeline is `CREATED`, send this to `POST /images`:

```json
{"pipelineId": "pipe-example"}
```

The response is `202` with the existing internal `imageId`. Image-build POST is
intentionally not idempotent and is explicitly outside Terraform scope; repeating
it can launch another billable build. Poll `GET /images/{imageId}`
with `pipeline.read` until `image.status` becomes `CREATED` or `FAILED`.
`image.imageUpstreamId` is the resulting AMI ID when available. Builds still run
through the existing Image Builder and event-processing workflow.

No deployment or live build has been performed as part of local verification.

## Errors

Errors use `application/problem+json` and a stable machine-readable `code`:

```json
{
  "type": "https://problems.virtual-engineering-workbench.dev/project-access-denied",
  "title": "Forbidden",
  "status": 403,
  "detail": "The client is not assigned to this project.",
  "code": "PROJECT_ACCESS_DENIED",
  "requestId": "request-id",
  "retryable": false
}
```

Clients should branch on `code`, not `title` or `detail`. Retry transient errors only
when `retryable` is `true`, and inspect current state before replaying any
non-idempotent request.
